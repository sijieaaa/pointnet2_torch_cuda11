# pointnet2_torch_cuda11
- A new implementation for PointNet++, https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.02413

- This is based on votenet/pointnet2/, https://github.com/facebookresearch/votenet/tree/main/pointnet2

- We fix some bugs of the above old pointnet2, and create this new pointnet2. 

- This pointnet2 works well in the following envs:

```
pytorch 1.5+
CUDA 11.3/11.6
python 3.6/3.7/3.8
ubuntu 18.04/20.04
```
